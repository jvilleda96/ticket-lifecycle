<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

1) I log into my osTicket agent account to view all pending tickets. In this example I am logging in as an admin.

   Home dashboard shows pending tickets as soon as I login.

2) As an admin I review the ticket and adjust priority and assignment. In this example I adjusted the priority to "Emergency" and the SLA to "SEV-A" because this is an issue that is affecting business. I've also    transferred it to the "System Administrators" group, assigning it to myself, an administrator.

   In this example I respond with an immediate solution, changing the ticket status to "Resolved".

3) This next ticket is less urgent, so I adjusted the settings as such.

   I re-assigned the ticket to my team member, Jane Doe, letting her know with a friendly phone call. I also responded to the client to make them aware of this hand off.

I've now shown how I would personally handle any help desk tickets, both as an agent and a manager.
